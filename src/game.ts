  # Chapter 1: The Station Beyond the Veil

  You awaken beneath gaslit eaves in a train station that exists beyond the veil.

  *Shadows flicker, whispering promises from beyond the fading lights.*
  *The air hums with the unspoken thoughts of the asleep, and your senses quiver with both dread and wonder.*

  *Tonight, you are waiting for your train.*

  Where does it take you?
