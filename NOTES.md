These are just random design notes and ideas for the project.

## Mechanisms

I am thinking of a new way to make this work. The LLm should have no control over the game (no tools) instead the game
automatically invokes it to write prose for descriptions of things and events.

The events and the generation of things is determined by randomly picked keywords meant to guide the LLM

For example a quest can have a subject, verb, object. Such as "innkeeper" "lost" "money" or "scoundrel" "killed" "mayor" etc

An object can have a few keywords to define it.

The LLM can weave these into prose. Same with events, random chance weighted with attributes can determine success - for example a "Strength" check
of difficulty 15 can be weighted against a 2d6 roll + the strength attribute of the character.

The result can be given adjective modifiers to improve the flavor text generated by the LLM.

A name generator is also needed for people, places, items, monsters, and possibly more.

Procedural generation with the LLM can help generate things like services at shops, locations, etc.
